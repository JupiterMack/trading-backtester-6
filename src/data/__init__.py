"""
Initializes the 'data' subpackage.

This subpackage is responsible for handling all aspects of historical data:
- Loading data from various sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, local CSV).
- Preprocessing data (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing formats).
- Providing interfaces for other parts of the backtester to access data.

This __init__.py file primarily serves to mark 'src/data' as a Python package.
It can also be used to define package-level variables or import commonly used
functions/classes from its modules to make them directly accessible
under the 'src.data' namespace.
"""

# No specific code or imports are required here for basic package initialization.
# Modules within this package (e.g., data_loader.py, data_processor.py)
# will contain the actual implementation details.
