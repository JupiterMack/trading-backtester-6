"""
Initializes the 'utils' subpackage.

This subpackage is intended to house general utility functions and helper classes
that are used across different parts of the algorithmic trading backtester
but do not fit into more specific categories like data handling, strategy
implementation, backtesting engine, or analysis.

Examples of utilities that might be found here include:
- Helper functions for logging configuration.
- Generic data manipulation helpers not specific to preprocessing.
- Common validation functions.
- File and path management utilities.
- Error handling mechanisms.
"""

# No specific functions or classes are exposed directly at the package level
# by default. Individual utility modules within this subpackage will be
# imported as needed by other parts of the application.
